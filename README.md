HINT: In order to be able to read the coverage file, the images (a.k.a libraries, executables) that were executed during testing must be accesible and in the directory where they were executed.


Examples
--------

    # Generates an html report of the coverage
    VisualCoverage.exe --input file.coverage --html report.html

    # Generates a clover report from the coverage file
    VisualCoverage.exe --input somefile.coverage --clover clover.xml

    # Generates both reports from a single input file
    VisualCoverage.exe --input otherfile.coverage --html report.html --clover clover.xml

    # Generates html report excluding all tests files
    VisualCoverage.exe --input file.coverage --html report.html --exclude-file .*test.*
    
    # Generates html report excluding namespace1 and namespace2
    VisualCoverage.exe --input file.coverage --html report.html --exclude-namespace namespace1 -- exclude-namespace namespace2
